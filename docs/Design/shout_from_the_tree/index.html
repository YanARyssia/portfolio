                This project helped students to gain a further sense of hierarchies as well as to gain additional experience with grids. Students had to research and collect open access images based on a chosen artist and create a poster for a virtual lecture about the artist. I chose Chuck Close - one of my favorite portrait painters. He uses a unique spraying technique to create a kaleidoscope feel. I repeated his names to represent his style in making different versions of the same character repeatedly
